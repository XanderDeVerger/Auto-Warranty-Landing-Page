<h1>How Does an Extended Auto Warranty Work?</h1>
<p>Many drivers hear about auto warranties but aren’t exactly sure what they do. Let’s break down how an extended auto warranty actually works—and how it can save you from big repair bills.</p>

<h2>What Is an Extended Auto Warranty?</h2>
<p>An extended auto warranty is a service contract that covers certain repair costs after your manufacturer’s warranty expires. It helps protect you from paying out-of-pocket for parts and labor when something goes wrong.</p>

<h2>What Does It Cover?</h2>
<p>Depending on your plan, coverage can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engine and transmission repairs</li>
<li>Electrical system failures</li>
<li>Air conditioning and heating</li>
<li>Steering and suspension</li>
<li>And much more</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Do You Use It?</h2>
<p>When your car breaks down, you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Call your warranty provider or submit a claim.</li>
<li>Take your vehicle to an approved repair shop.</li>
<li>Pay your deductible (if any).</li>
<li>The warranty company pays the rest directly to the repair shop.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How Much Does It Cost?</h2>
<p>Costs vary by vehicle, mileage, and coverage level. The best way to find out is to request a free quote.</p>
